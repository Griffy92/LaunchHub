## üìÑ General Info
SHIFT was developed as part of the Collabathon and led by a dedicated team comprising Dom, Jessica, Natalie, and Roxanne. We worked together intensively over a weekend with the goal of leveraging our diverse skill sets, creativity, and collaboration to build an impactful and responsive app for startups. Throughout the Collabathon, we embraced challenges, brainstormed ideas, and implemented our collective knowledge to bring SHIFT to life.
